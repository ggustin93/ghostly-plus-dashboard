# docker-compose.override.yml
# Use this file to override settings in docker-compose.yml for local development.
# For example:
# services:
#   backend:
#     ports:
#       - "8001:8000" # Map backend to a different host port
#     environment:
#       - DEBUG=True

# Currently empty, as development settings are included in the main docker-compose.yml
