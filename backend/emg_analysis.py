EMG Analysis Functions Module
=============================

This module contains a collection of functions for calculating various
EMG (Electromyography) metrics from signal data. Each function is designed
to be a standalone calculation that can be easily integrated into a larger
processing pipeline. The hypotheses and implementation choices for each metric are documented below.

DISCLAIMER: This module was written with AI assistance (Claude and Perplexity AI, June 2025) 
and requires validation by qualified medical professionals before clinical application.

Key parameters requiring clinical validation:

1. Signal Processing:
   - Minimum samples: 256 for spectral analysis
   - Welch's method with nperseg=256 for PSD estimation

2. Amplitude Metrics:
   - RMS/MAV correlation with muscle activation level

3. Fatigue Analysis:
   - MPF/MDF decrease threshold for clinical fatigue (typically >10%)
   - Dimitrov's FI_nsm5 index clinical significance threshold

4. Contraction Detection:
   - Threshold factor: 20-30% of max amplitude
   - Minimum contraction duration (ms)
   - Smoothing window size (recommend ~50ms)
   - Merge threshold: 200ms for physiological contractions
   - Refractory period: currently 0ms (disabled)

5. MVC Analysis:
   - Threshold for "good" contractions

Detailed hypotheses for each parameter are documented within the relevant function docstrings.

    """
    Analyzes a signal to detect contractions and calculate related stats.
    If mvc_amplitude_threshold is provided, contractions are also flagged as 'good'.

    Biomedical Hypothesis: EMG signals during muscle contractions can exhibit oscillatory patterns
    due to motor unit firing synchronization, tremor, or mechanical artifacts. These oscillations
    may cause the signal to briefly drop below the detection threshold during what is physiologically
    a single contraction event. The merge_threshold_ms parameter addresses this by treating closely
    spaced contractions as a single physiological event, better reflecting the actual muscle activity.
    
    Clinical Assumptions:
    - Threshold factor: 20-30% of maximum amplitude is typical for contraction detection
      (Research suggests 20% of MVC or peak-to-peak amplitude as common clinical practice)
    - Minimum duration: Clinically significant contractions should exceed a minimum duration
      (Research suggests minimum durations in tens of milliseconds)
    - Smoothing window: ~50ms windows common in clinical practice
    - Merge threshold: 200ms default for physiologically related contractions
      (Based on typical motor unit firing rates and muscle response times)
    - Refractory period: 0ms default (disabled)
      (May need adjustment based on specific muscle physiology)
    - MVC threshold: External threshold represents clinically significant contraction level

    Args:
        signal: A numpy array of the EMG signal (can be raw, not rectified).
        sampling_rate: The sampling rate of the signal in Hz.
        threshold_factor: The percentage of the maximum signal amplitude to use
                        as the detection threshold (e.g., 0.3 for 30%).
        min_duration_ms: The minimum duration in milliseconds for a detected event
                         to be considered a contraction.
        smoothing_window: The size of the moving average window to smooth the signal.
        mvc_amplitude_threshold: Optional. If provided, contractions with max_amplitude
                                 at or above this value are considered 'good'.
                                 This can be channel-specific from session_mvc_values.
        merge_threshold_ms: The maximum time gap in milliseconds between two detected contractions
                           to consider them as a single physiological contraction. Default is 200ms,
                           which is based on typical motor unit firing rates and muscle response times.
        refractory_period_ms: The minimum time in milliseconds after a contraction ends before
                             a new contraction can be detected. Default is 0ms (disabled).

# --- Amplitude-based Metrics ---

def calculate_rms(signal: np.ndarray, sampling_rate: int) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculates the Root Mean Square (RMS) of the signal.

    Biomedical Hypothesis: The amplitude of the surface EMG signal is, under
    non-fatiguing and isometric conditions, proportionally related to the force of
    muscle contraction. RMS is a measure of the signal's power and serves as a
    robust estimator of muscle activation intensity. An increase in RMS can
    indicate greater motor unit recruitment and thus improved muscle strength.
    
    Clinical Assumptions:
    - EMG amplitude linearly relates to muscle activation under non-fatiguing, isometric conditions
    - No normalization to MVC is performed within this function (must be done externally if needed)
    - Signal linearity assumption may not hold during dynamic contractions or fatigue

    Calculates the Mean Absolute Value (MAV) of the signal.

    Biomedical Hypothesis: Similar to RMS, MAV quantifies the EMG signal's
    amplitude and correlates with contraction level. It's computationally simpler
    than RMS and less sensitive to large, sporadic spikes in the signal, making
    it a stable estimator of muscle activity.
    
    Clinical Assumptions:
    - MAV correlates with muscle contraction level
    - MAV is less sensitive to sporadic spikes compared to RMS
    - No normalization to MVC is performed (must be done externally)

    this by averaging the periodograms of overlapping segments, reducing noise.
    
    Clinical Assumptions:

def calculate_mpf(signal: np.ndarray, sampling_rate: int) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Calculates the Mean Power Frequency (MPF) of the signal.

    Biomedical Hypothesis: During sustained muscle contractions, metabolic byproducts
    accumulate, which slows the conduction velocity of muscle fibers. This physiological
    change manifests as a compression of the EMG power spectrum towards lower
    frequencies. MPF, the average frequency of the spectrum, will decrease as
    fatigue sets in, making it a classic indicator of muscle fatigue.
    
    Clinical Assumptions:
    - MPF decrease indicates muscle fatigue
    - Typical clinical threshold for fatigue: >10% decrease from baseline
    - Spectral compression reflects slowing of muscle fiber conduction velocity
    - Requires sufficient signal quality and length for reliable estimation

    Calculates the Median Frequency (MDF) of the signal.

    Biomedical Hypothesis: MDF is the frequency that divides the power spectrum
    into two halves of equal power. Like MPF, MDF decreases with muscle fatigue

    more robust than MPF because it is less affected by noise and random spikes
    in the power spectrum.

    Calculates Dimitrov's Fatigue Index (FI_nsm5) using normalized spectral moments.

    Biomedical Hypothesis: This index is a sensitive measure of muscle fatigue,
    designed to capture the compression and shape change of the power spectrum more
    effectively than mean or median frequency alone. It's the ratio of a low-frequency
    spectral moment (order -1) to a high-frequency one (order 5). As fatigue develops,
    power shifts to lower frequencies, increasing the numerator and decreasing the
    denominator, thus causing a significant rise in the index value.
    
    Clinical Assumptions:
    - FI_nsm5 is more sensitive to fatigue than MPF/MDF alone
    - Increasing values indicate increasing fatigue
    - No specific threshold for clinical significance is defined (needs validation)
