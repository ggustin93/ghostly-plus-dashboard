# Contributing to GHOSTLY+ Dashboard

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the GHOSTLY+ Dashboard project! Please take a moment to review these guidelines.

## Development Workflow

- **Task Management**: We use Taskmaster for managing tasks. Please refer to the `tasks/` directory and use `task-master` CLI or associated MCP tools to view and update tasks.
- **Branching**: Please create a new branch for each feature or bugfix you work on. Branch names should be descriptive (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `fix/report-generation-bug`).
- **Commits**: Write clear and concise commit messages. Reference relevant task IDs if applicable (e.g., `feat: Implement login page (Task #12)`).
- **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests to the `main` or `develop` branch (as specified by the project leads). Ensure your PR includes a clear description of the changes and passes all CI checks.
- **Code Style**: Follow the established code style for the respective parts of the project (Python/FastAPI for backend, Vue.js/TypeScript for frontend). Linters and formatters should be configured and used.

## Setting up the Environment

Please refer to the `README.md` and `docs/development_setup.md` (to be created) for instructions on setting up your local development environment.

## Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an issue in the project's issue tracker (if available) or create a bug-fix task in Taskmaster. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce, expected behavior, and actual behavior.

## Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are welcome! Please discuss them with the project team or create a feature request task in Taskmaster.

## Questions

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
