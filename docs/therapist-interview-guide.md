### **Agenda**

**(5 min) 1. Introduction & Goal Setting**

*   Welcome & Thank You
*   Our Goal Today: To learn from your expertise to build a tool that truly supports you.
*   Your Role: You are the expert. Your honest and direct feedback is the most valuable contribution you can make.
*   What We'll See: Early-stage concepts and mockups – nothing is final.

**(10 min) 2. Understanding Your Current World**

*   A day in the life: How do you currently track patient rehabilitation and progress?
*   Defining success: What signals tell you a patient is adhering to their plan and performing exercises well?
*   Identifying pain points: What are the most time-consuming aspects of managing this process now?

**(25 min) 3. Interactive Design Walkthrough**

*   **Part A: The "Triage" Dashboard – Who needs my attention?**
    *   We'll look at the main dashboard, summary cards, and the priority patient list.
    *   **Key Questions:**
        -   "At a glance, what does this screen tell you?"
        -   "If you saw a patient in the 'Priority' list, what would be your immediate next step?"

*   **Part B: The "Deep Dive" – What is happening with this patient?**
    *   We'll review the detailed Performance Analysis for a single session.
    *   **Key Questions:**
        -   "How would this detailed view change your clinical judgment or conversation with the patient?"
        -   "Is seeing the patient's subjective exertion next to the objective EMG data valuable? Why?"
        -   "Is there anything on this screen that feels like noise? Anything critical that's missing?"

*   **Part C: The Workflow – How does this fit your day?**
    *   We'll quickly walk through the patient onboarding and login process.
    *   **Goal:** To confirm the proposed workflow is intuitive for both normal use and the trial.
    *   **Key Questions (Onboarding):**
        -   "For normal use, does directly adding a patient via a simple form make sense?"
        -   "For the trial, is selecting from a pre-loaded list a reasonable adaptation?"
    *   **Key Questions (Patient Autonomy & Login):**
        -   "We're assuming patients will do sessions on their own after an initial training. The app will have guides for setup (MVC, BFR). Is this realistic for your patients?"
        -   "For the trial, we're proposing a very simple login (PID + shared password). Any concerns with this approach?"

*   **Part D: The Actionable Output – How do you use this data?**
    *   We'll discuss the concept of generating a formal report from the analysis.
    *   **Key Question:** "Is there a need to export this data (e.g., as a PDF) for patient records or team communication?"

**(5 min) 4. Closing Discussion & Next Steps**
*   Key Takeaways: A brief summary of what we've learned from you.
*   Final Thoughts: Are there any critical aspects we haven't touched upon?
*   Thank You & Future Collaboration.
