## Trial Description

### Study Design

The focus of this study can be divided into two research questions:

1. The effectiveness of the Ghostly app (as an additional training to conventional therapy) in relation to strength gain
2. The effect of Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) during isometric strength training compared to standard isometric strength training

For this study, a gaming app (Ghostly) was developed in which the main character is controlled through muscle contractions measured using electromyography (EMG). EMG-electrodes connected to the Ghostly app will be placed on the targeted muscles and register muscle contractions. The purpose of the app is to train the muscles in a stimulating and challenging environment by completing levels. These levels are adjusted to adhere to strength training guidelines based on literature.

In total three single-blinded randomized controlled trials (RCT) will be organized:
- One RCT investigates acute and subacute stroke patients
- One RCT investigates hospitalized elderly
- One RCT investigates patients recovering from COVID-19 and ICU patients

Each population will be randomized into three groups using sealed envelopes containing ten notes which will be marked with "Ghostly", followed by "A"(conventional therapy) or "B" (blood flow restriction), and five notes marked "leaflet". Every group will receive dose-matched conventional therapy, but the second experimental group will receive an adjusted version of their conventional therapy which includes isometric strength training using blood flow restriction.

Each group will also receive instructions for an additional strength training program which participants will have to complete unsupervised. The first and second group will receive the strength training program incorporated in the Ghostly app. The control group on the other hand will be given a leaflet which includes instructions on performing exercises without the use of the Ghostly app. These exercises will be matched in terms of repetitions, sets and inter-set rest to match the intensity of the Ghostly app.

### Analysis

After the data for the entire sample is collected, the analysis will be performed using SPSS 27 (IBM, New York). A significance level of 0.05 will be used throughout the entire analysis.

Descriptive statistics of the baseline characteristics of all participants will be performed. A normal distribution of the data will be assessed using the Levene's test. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used to assess the differences in dependent variables with respect to within-group variables and between-group variables. These differences will be expressed as mean differences. Additionally, a Tukey post hoc test will be done to compare mean differences for true significance.

For the analysis of the USE questionnaire, percentage distribution of every item and mean scores for every subscale will be calculated using Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, Washington, DC).

## Interventions

### 1. Ghostly app
**Type:** OTHER  
**Study arms:** Ghostly

For the Ghostly app, we include three different trainings:
- **Standard training**: Three sets of twelve muscle contractions with 120 seconds of rest between each set
- **Cluster set 1**: Three sets of twelve repetitions with ten seconds of rest between each contraction
- **Cluster set 2**: Three sets of twelve repetitions with 30 seconds of rest after three consecutive contractions

Each set of twelve contractions will be considered as one level in the game that needs to be ended before taking rest. The intensity at which will be trained is 75% of maximum voluntary contraction.

### 2. Blood flow restriction
**Type:** OTHER  
**Study arms:** Blood flow restriction and Ghostly

Patients will complete four sets of 15 repetitions, with each contraction lasting three seconds. Similar to the first experimental group and control group, the training intensity will be set at 100%MVC with two minutes of rest between sets. The cuff pressure will be set at 50% of arterial occlusion pressure.

### 3. Leaflet
**Type:** OTHER  
**Study arms:** Control

This training program will be matched with the Ghostly game in terms of repetitions, sets and inter-set rest and will be given to the patient to complete without supervision of the therapist.

## Outcome Measures

    The time the patient is bedridden due to muscle weakness will be assessed

11. **Change in Motricity index from baseline to 2 weeks of intervention**  
    For the stroke population, the knee and hip movement test of the Motricity Index will be used as a screening tool and will be assessed after the intervention.

    The opinion of the patient in terms of his recovery will be assessed using the Global Perceived Effect questionnaire. This questionnaire has a minimum value of 2 and a maximum value of 14, with a lower score translating to satisfied with the rate of recovery.

18. **Therapy compliance and adherence**  
    Therapy adherence is defined as attendance to the instructed number of sessions and will be calculated as the number of exercise sessions completed, divided by the number of sessions prescribed. Therapy compliance refers to the prescribed intensity, frequency, and duration of the exercises. This will be calculated by dividing the training load by the prescribed training load and dividing the performed number of repetitions by the prescribed number of repetitions.

19. **User experience with a modified version of the USE questionnaire**  
    User experience of the Ghostly game will be assessed using a translated version of the self-administered Usefulness, Satisfaction and Ease of use (USE) questionnaire. This scale ranges from 30 to 210, with a higher score translating to higher satisfaction. Additionally, open questions were added to the questionnaire to uncover possible barriers and facilitators in the use of the game.
