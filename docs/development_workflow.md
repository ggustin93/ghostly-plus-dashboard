# GHOSTLY+ Dashboard: Development Workflow

This document outlines the development workflow and practices for the GHOSTLY+ Dashboard project.

## Task Management with Task Master

This project utilizes **Task Master** for managing development tasks. Key aspects of its usage include:

-   **Initialization**: Tasks are often initially generated by parsing a Product Requirements Document (PRD) or a similar specification file (e.g., `[docs/prd.md](mdc:docs/prd.md)`) using Task Master's `parse_prd` capabilities.
-   **Task Structure**: Tasks are defined with details such as title, description, status, dependencies, priority, implementation details, and test strategies. These are typically stored in a `tasks.json` file and may be broken down into individual markdown files in a `tasks/` directory.
-   **Core Workflow**: The general development workflow involves:
    -   Listing current tasks (`get_tasks` / `task-master list`).
    -   Determining the next appropriate task (`next_task` / `task-master next`).
    -   Understanding task details (`get_task` / `task-master show <id>`).
    -   Analyzing task complexity (`analyze_project_complexity`) and reviewing reports (`complexity_report`) before breaking down tasks.
    -   Breaking down complex tasks into subtasks (`expand_task` / `task-master expand`), potentially using `--force` or `--research` flags.
    -   Updating task status as work progresses (`set_task_status` / `task-master set-status`).
    -   Adding new tasks or subtasks as they are identified (`add_task`, `add_subtask`).
    -   Updating existing tasks if requirements or implementation plans change (`update_task`, `update`).
    -   Managing dependencies between tasks (`add_dependency`, `remove_dependency`, `validate_dependencies`, `fix_dependencies`).
    -   Generating individual task files if needed (`generate` / `task-master generate`).
-   **Interaction**: While Task Master can be used via its CLI (`task-master`), within this AI-assisted development environment, it's primarily interacted with using integrated tools that call its underlying functions (MCP tools), guided by internal rules and the [Task Master Development Workflow rule](mdc:.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc).

Familiarity with Task Master's concepts is crucial for understanding project progress and contributing to development. For detailed command references, consult the Task Master documentation or use `task-master --help` for CLI interactions.

## Codebase Navigation & Understanding

-   **Memory Bank**: An AI-assisted context management system (`memory-bank/` directory) is used to maintain project understanding across development sessions. It contains summaries and distillations of core project documents and active decisions.
    -   `memory-bank/projectbrief.md`: Core project goals and scope.
    -   `memory-bank/productContext.md`: The "why" behind the project.
    -   `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`: Architecture and key technical decisions.
    -   `memory-bank/techContext.md`: Technologies and setup.
    -   `memory-bank/activeContext.md`: Current focus and recent changes.
    -   `memory-bank/progress.md`: What's done and what's next.
-   **Source Documents**: Key information is also located in:
    -   `[docs/prd.md](mdc:docs/prd.md)`: Product Requirements Document.
    -   `[docs/task-summary.md](mdc:docs/task-summary.md)`: High-level task overview.
    -   `[docs/security.md](mdc:docs/security.md)`: Security architecture.

## Development Environment Setup

(Details on configuring the local development environment, Docker setup, Supabase local instance, etc. - To be defined based on [docs/prd.md](mdc:docs/prd.md) Section 4.10 and 5.1)

## Coding Standards & Conventions

(Details on linting, formatting, naming conventions, etc. - To be defined)

## Testing Strategy

- Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles are encouraged.
- Backend (FastAPI):
    - Unit and integration tests for critical components (endpoints, C3D parsing, EMG processing).
- Frontend (Vue.js):
    - Component and integration tests (e.g., using Vue Test Utils).
    - End-to-end testing (e.g., using Cypress).
- Continuous Integration (CI) with automated test runs on each commit.

## Branching Strategy & Version Control

-   **Git** is used for version control.
-   (Specific branching model like GitFlow, GitHub Flow, or trunk-based development - To be defined)

## Commit Message Guidelines

-   (Adherence to a convention like Conventional Commits - To be defined)

## Deployment

-   Containerization with Docker & Docker Compose.
-   Deployment to VUB Private VM.
-   CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
