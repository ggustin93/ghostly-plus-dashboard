# GHOSTLY+ Dashboard Project Timeline (5-Month Estimate)

This document provides a high-level estimated timeline for the GHOSTLY+ Dashboard project, spanning approximately 5 months.

## Project Timeline Overview

| Phase                                   | Estimated Duration | Main Focus                                                                 | Key Tasks                 |
| :-------------------------------------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------ |
| **Month 1: Foundation & Setup**         | **~4 Weeks**       | Infrastructure, Authentication, Core Setup                               | Tasks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5       |
| **Month 2: Core Features**              | **~4 Weeks**       | Patient/Cohort Management, Game Integration, Backend API                 | Tasks 6, 7, 8, 9        |
| **Month 3: Visualization & Analysis**   | **~4 Weeks**       | EMG Visualization, Game Performance, Session Management, Reporting         | Tasks 10, 11, 12, 13    |
| **Month 4: UI, Security & Compliance**  | **~5 Weeks**       | Dashboards, Encryption, GDPR, Accessibility, Multilingual Support          | Tasks 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 |
| **Month 5: Finalization & Deployment**  | **~4 Weeks**       | Optimization, Security Testing, Deployment Pipeline, Documentation, User Testing | Tasks 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 |

**Note:** This is a high-level estimate. Actual durations may vary based on complexity, resource availability, and feedback.

**Agile Approach:** This timeline serves as a general roadmap. The project will follow an **agile development methodology**, involving iterative sprints (e.g., 2 weeks) and continuous feedback. Therefore, expect **flexibility and potential overlap between phases** based on evolving priorities and discoveries. User testing and feedback (Task 25) will be integrated throughout the development cycle, not just at the end.

## Detailed Phase Breakdown

### Month 1: Foundation & Setup (Tasks 1-5)
*   **Focus**: Setting up the core infrastructure and foundational elements.
*   **Activities**: Repository setup, Docker/Nginx configuration, local Supabase environment, core authentication system, database schema design, C3D parser development.
*   **Goal**: Have a functional local development environment and core infrastructure ready.

### Month 2: Core Features (Tasks 6-9)
*   **Focus**: Building the fundamental application logic and management systems.
*   **Activities**: Patient & cohort management APIs and UI stubs, integrating with the OpenFeasyo game, implementing the main backend API endpoints.
*   **Goal**: Core data management features are functional and integrated.

### Month 3: Visualization & Analysis (Tasks 10-13)
*   **Focus**: Developing the data visualization and reporting capabilities.
*   **Activities**: Building interactive EMG charts, game performance metrics, session tracking, and report generation system.
*   **Goal**: Key data insights are visualized and reportable.

### Month 4: UI, Security & Compliance (Tasks 14-20)
*   **Focus**: Implementing user interfaces, security measures, and compliance.
*   **Activities**: Building therapist and researcher dashboards, implementing data encryption/pseudonymization, ensuring GDPR compliance, adding accessibility and multilingual support.
*   **Goal**: User-facing dashboards are functional, data is secured, and compliance requirements are met.

### Month 5: Finalization & Deployment (Tasks 21-25)
*   **Focus**: Optimizing, testing, documenting, and preparing for deployment.
*   **Activities**: Performance optimization, comprehensive security testing, setting up CI/CD pipeline, writing documentation, conducting user testing, and implementing feedback.
*   **Goal**: Application is production-ready, documented, tested, and deployed (potentially on VUB VM if available).
