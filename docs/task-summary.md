# GHOSTLY+ Dashboard Project Task Summary

This document provides an overview of the main tasks for the development of the GHOSTLY+ Dashboard, a system for visualizing and analyzing EMG data for game therapy.

## Project Phase Structure

The project is organized according to a logical progression, from infrastructure setup to advanced features:

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (Tasks 1-5)

- **Task 1**: Project and Repository Configuration
  - Project structure and development environment
  - Docker and Nginx configuration for simplified deployment
  - Automation scripts to facilitate deployment
  
- **Task 2**: Supabase Infrastructure Configuration
  - Local deployment for immediate development
  - Later configuration on VUB VM for production
  - Authentication, database, and storage services
  
- **Task 3**: Authentication and Authorization System
  - Unified authentication between the game and web dashboard
  - Role management (therapists, researchers, administrators)
  - Optional 2FA/MFA (TOTP) support for enhanced security (User/Admin choice)
  
- **Task 4**: Database Schema Design and Implementation
  - Data models for patients, sessions, EMG data
  
- **Task 5**: C3D File Parser Development
  - Extraction of EMG data from C3D files
  - Data preprocessing for analysis

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Tasks 6-9)

- **Task 6**: Patient Management System
  - Patient profiles, medical information, history
  
- **Task 7**: Cohort Management System
  - Grouping patients for research
  
- **Task 8**: OpenFeasyo Game Integration
  - Connection between the Android game and the dashboard
  
- **Task 9**: Backend API Implementation
  - Main endpoints for the various features

### Phase 3: Visualization and Analysis (Tasks 10-13)

- **Task 10**: EMG Data Visualization Components
  - Interactive charts and visualizations
  
- **Task 11**: Game Performance Analysis Components
  - Metrics and statistics for game sessions
  
- **Task 12**: Session Management System
  - Tracking of therapeutic sessions
  
- **Task 13**: Report Generation System
  - Creation of detailed reports for therapists/researchers

### Phase 4: Security and Compliance (Tasks 14-15)

- **Task 14**: Data Encryption and Pseudonymization System
  - Protection of sensitive data
  
- **Task 15**: GDPR Compliance Features
  - Consent management, right to be forgotten

### Phase 5: User Interfaces (Tasks 16-20)

- **Task 16**: Therapist Dashboard
  - Specific interface for therapists
  
- **Task 17**: Researcher Dashboard
  - Specific interface for researchers
  
- **Task 18**: Advanced EMG Analytics Implementation
  - In-depth analysis algorithms
  
- **Task 19**: Multilingual Support
  - Interface internationalization
  
- **Task 20**: Accessibility Implementation
  - WCAG compliance, use with assistive technologies

### Phase 6: Finalization and Deployment (Tasks 21-25)

- **Task 21**: Performance Optimization
  - Improving loading times and responsiveness
  
- **Task 22**: Security Testing and Hardening
  - Security audit, fixes, penetration testing
  
- **Task 23**: Deployment Pipeline Setup
  - CI/CD for automated deployment
  
- **Task 24**: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
  - User and developer guides
  
- **Task 25**: User Testing and Feedback Implementation
  - Testing sessions with real users

## Key Dependencies

- Infrastructure tasks (1-5) are prerequisites for most features
- Authentication system (3) and database schema (4) are critical dependencies
- Dashboards (16-17) depend on management and visualization systems

## Priorities

- **High priority**: Infrastructure, security, authentication, database
- **Medium priority**: Application features, user interfaces, optimization
- **Low priority**: Multilingual support

## Key Development Points

1. **Simplified Deployment**: Optimized Docker and Nginx configuration for deployment in just a few commands
2. **Unified Authentication**: Common system between the game and web dashboard
3. **Data Security**: Encryption and pseudonymization to protect medical data
4. **Modular Architecture**: Clear separation between frontend, backend, and services
5. **Adapted Interface**: Dashboards specific to the needs of therapists and researchers

This task structure allows for progressive and coherent development of the GHOSTLY+ Dashboard system.
