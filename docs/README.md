# Ghostly+ Documentation

Welcome to the Ghostly+ documentation repository! This directory contains comprehensive documentation for the Ghostly+ Dashboard system, a web application supporting an EMG-driven serious game designed to combat muscle strength loss in hospitalized elderly patients.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into five main sections, each serving a distinct purpose in explaining the Ghostly+ system:

### 1. Requirements (`/requirements`)

Contains the foundational documents that define what we're building:

- **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](requirements/prd.md)** - The comprehensive specification of the system, including goals, features, architecture, and timeline.
- **[UI/UX Screens](requirements/ui_ux_screens.md)** - Detailed specifications for each screen in the user interface, organized by user role (therapist, researcher, administrator).
  - Includes a **Requirements Traceability Matrix** that maps PRD functional requirements to specific UI screens, ensuring complete coverage of all requirements.

### 2. Architecture (`/architecture`)

Explains how the system is designed and how data flows through it:

- **[Overview](architecture/overview.md)** - High-level architecture of the system.
- **[Layered Diagram](architecture/layered_diagram.md)** - Visual representation of the system's layered architecture.
- **[Security](architecture/security.md)** - Security architecture and GDPR compliance details.
- **[Data Flow](architecture/data_flow.md)** - Diagrams and descriptions of data flow through the system, including primary and fallback pathways.

### 3. Technical Reference (`/technical`)

Provides detailed technical information for developers:

- **[Stack Overview](technical/stack_overview.md)** - Technology stack overview and rationale.
- **[EMG Analysis](technical/emg_analysis.md)** - Technical details of EMG signal processing and analysis, including implementation patterns.
- **[Supabase Auth](technical/supabase_csharp_auth.md)** - C# integration with Supabase Authentication for the game component.
- **[Supabase Auth Fix](technical/supabase-auth-fix.md)** - Solutions for common authentication issues.
- **[API Documentation](technical/api/endpoints.md)** - Detailed API endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

### 4. Guides (`/guides`)

Provides practical instructions for various tasks:

- **[Development Workflow](guides/development_workflow.md)** - Guide for developers working on the project.
- **[Deployment](guides/deployment.md)** - Instructions for deploying the system in various environments.
- **[Environments](guides/environments)** - Environment-specific configuration and setup.

### 5. Project Management (`/project`)

Contains documents related to project planning and tracking:

- **[Timeline](project/timeline.md)** - Project timeline and milestones.
- **[Task Summary](project/task_summary.md)** - Summary of development tasks.
- **[Meeting Notes](project/meeting_notes/)** - Notes from project meetings.

## Navigation Tips

- Start with the [PRD](requirements/prd.md) for a complete understanding of the project goals and requirements
- Review the [UI/UX Screens](requirements/ui_ux_screens.md) document for a visual understanding of the interfaces
- Check the [Data Flow](architecture/data_flow.md) to understand how information moves through the system
- Use the [EMG Analysis](technical/emg_analysis.md) document for implementing the metrics processing logic
- Refer to the [Deployment Guide](guides/deployment.md) when preparing for production deployment

## Document Conventions

- All documentation is written in Markdown format
- Diagrams use Mermaid syntax for version control and easy updates
- Code examples include language identifiers for syntax highlighting
- Cross-references use relative links to other documents

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to this documentation:

1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Use Markdown for all documents
3. Include diagrams where appropriate using Mermaid
4. Cross-reference related documents
5. Keep technical implementation details in the `/technical` directory
6. Place UI/UX specifications in the `/requirements` directory

## Generating Documentation

The markdown documentation can be converted to HTML or PDF formats using tools like:

- [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) - For generating a searchable web documentation
- [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) - For converting to PDF or other formats

## Documentation TODOs

- [x] ~~Complete API endpoint documentation~~ API endpoints will be partially auto-generated by FastAPI (see [API Endpoints Documentation](technical/api/endpoints.md))
- [ ] Add detailed database schema documentation
- [ ] Create user guide for therapists
- [ ] Add more examples to the deployment guide
- [ ] Document test methodology and coverage
