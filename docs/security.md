## 1. Overview of Core Security Measures

This section outlines the comprehensive security strategy for the GHOSTLY+ application, designed to protect sensitive medical data across all architectural layers.

The GHOSTLY+ application implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers:

| Layer                    | Planned Protection Measures                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Frontend (Vue 3)**     | JWT handling, input sanitization (standard framework features)     |
| **API (FastAPI)**        | JWT validation, input validation, rate limiting (optional), encryption, pseudonymization |
| **Database (Local Supabase)** | RLS policies, backend-managed encryption, database-level security |
| **Transport**            | HTTPS/TLS (external access mandatory, internal recommended)        |
| **Infrastructure**       | Private VM, network controls, containerization (Docker)            |

The following core security measures are implemented throughout the application:

1.   User Authentication - Verifying user identity
2.   Authorization & Access Control - Enforcing appropriate access permissions
3.   Encryption of Sensitive Data - Protecting data confidentiality
4.   Pseudonymization - Enhancing privacy through data separation
5.   Database Access Security - Securing the data layer
6.   Transport Security - Protecting data in transit
7.   Server and Infrastructure Isolation - Securing the hosting environment
8.   Audit & Logging - Tracking security events
9.   C3D File Security - Specialized protection for medical data files

Each measure is detailed in the following sections, explaining implementation status and security benefits.

### 1.4. üîë User Authentication

**Core Technology**: **Self-hosted Supabase Auth** utilizing **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**.

*   **Mechanism**:
    *   Users authenticate via email + password.
    *   Supabase Auth issues a signed JWT upon successful login.
    *   Clients (Vue.js Dashboard, C# Game) send the JWT with each API request.
    *   FastAPI backend verifies JWT validity (via Supabase public keys) before authorizing access.
    *   Client-side token expiration and refresh mechanisms are required.
*   **Key Principle: Unified Authentication**:
    *   **Single Source of Truth**: Both Game and Dashboard use the same self-hosted Supabase Auth instance.
    *   **Consistent Experience**: Identical credentials and authentication flow across applications.
    *   **Centralized Management**: User accounts, permissions, and password resets are managed centrally.
*   **Implementation Details**:
    *   **Game (C#/MonoGame)**: Requires REST API calls to Supabase Auth endpoints.
    *   **Dashboard (Vue.js)**: Will use the Supabase JavaScript client library.
    *   Both will handle JWTs validated by the FastAPI backend.
*   **Benefits**:
    *   Complete control over authentication data and flows (due to local deployment).
    *   Consistent security enforcement and simplified auditing.
    *   Reduced attack surface and improved user experience (single credential set).
*   **Status**:
    *   Supabase Auth infrastructure: Established (Task 1).
    *   JWT handling (Vue), validation (FastAPI), Game integration: Planned for **Task 2 (User Authentication & Authorization)**.
*   ‚úÖ **Planned Result**: Only authenticated users can interact with the application.

### 1.4.1. Optional: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA)

*   **Availability**: Supabase Auth supports MFA (e.g., TOTP via authenticator apps).
*   **Implementation Status**: Optional feature, not planned for initial core functionality.
*   **Recommendation**: Offer as an optional security enhancement later if required.
