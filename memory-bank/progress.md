## What's Left to Build (Dashboard Focus, Supporting GHOSTLY+ Proposal WPs):

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON DEVELOPMENT ALIGNMENT WITH DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN (DMP):** All features outlined below, especially those involving any aspect of data handling (collection, input, storage, processing, visualization, security, retention, and export), **MUST** be developed in strict alignment with the **[Data Management Plan (data_management_plan.md)](mdc:docs/00_PROJECT_DEFINITION/ressources/data_management_plan.md)**. This includes adhering to the specified clinical variables, primary/secondary outcomes, data types, ethical guidelines (consent, pseudonymization), security protocols, and the defined roles for data systems (Supabase as operational DB; REDCap for eCRF/clinical trial master data/archive; Pixiu for long-term research data archive; SharePoint for documents). The DMP is the guiding document for these aspects.

### Phase 3: Authentication and Authorization System (Supporting WP2, WP3, WP4, WP5 - aligns with `UX_UI_specifications.md` Admin persona A1-A2)
1. ‚úÖ Implement basic email/password login (Done in consolidated React frontend).
2. ‚úÖ Implement session management (Done via Supabase client/Context).
3. ‚è≥ Integrate password reset functionality (Requires UI form and potentially Supabase Edge Function/backend logic - **A2**).
4. ‚è≥ Add user registration functionality (Likely admin-initiated or specific form for new study personnel - **A1, A2**).

    *   ‚è≥ View audit logs (requires logging mechanism).
    *   ‚è≥ Manage `EMGMetricDefinition` if extensible.
3.  **A3: Data Integrity & Management:**
    *   ‚è≥ Monitor data quality and completeness (e.g., orphaned records, missing C3D file links in `GameSession.c3d_file_storage_path`).
    *   ‚è≥ Oversee data backup/restore procedures (Supabase managed mostly, but admin needs awareness of DMP specified procedures including **manual encrypted HDD backups** and roles of **Pixiu, REDCap, SharePoint** for overall data security and archiving).
    *   ‚è≥ Manage data export configurations for REDCap/other systems.
4.  **A4: System Health & Monitoring:**
    *   ‚è≥ Dashboard for system performance (DB connections, API response times, storage usage from Supabase Storage).
    *   ‚è≥ Error log monitoring.

### Phase 7: Backend sEMG Processing & Game Data Integration (Supporting WP2, WP3)
1. ‚úÖ Create API (FastAPI) for C3D file processing (Basic endpoint created at `/v1/c3d/upload` - `GameSession.c3d_file_storage_path` is key).
2. ‚úÖ Implement file upload functionality (Frontend API client created with TypeScript interfaces).
3. ‚è≥ **Implement detailed sEMG-derived metrics calculation in backend ([WP2_proposal_detailed.md](mdc:docs/00_PROJECT_DEFINITION/ressources/WP2_proposal_detailed.md) Task 2.3, WP5):** As per proposal (fatigue indicators, strength/force estimations, mass estimations) and store in `EMGCalculatedMetric` table, linking to `GameSession` and `EMGMetricDefinition`, ensuring these support analysis of outcomes specified in `data_management_plan.md`.
4. ‚è≥ **Process and store detailed game statistics (WP2.3)** from game logs/C3D into `GamePlayStatistic` table, linking to `GameSession` and `GameLevel`, ensuring these support analysis of outcomes specified in `data_management_plan.md`.
5. ‚è≥ **Log DDA parameters (WP2.4)** used during a `GameSession` into `GameSession.dda_parameters_snapshot`.
6. ‚è≥ Establish API endpoints for game to send detailed logs if C3D is insufficient for all WP2.3/WP2.4 data.
7. ‚è≥ Ensure backend processing can handle data from different sensor types if integrated per WP2.2 (`GameSession.sensor_type_used`).

## Known Issues:

1. **Docker Stability**: Occasional issues with Docker restarts, may require system reboot to resolve. *(Seems less frequent now?)*
2. **Backend Dependencies**: Issues with ezc3d compilation in Docker build process (Python C extension).
3. **Frontend**: Need to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) checks for admin page.
4. **UI Component Styling**: *(Verify if Tailwind 4 / Shadcn UI issues from Vue project persist in Next.js/React setup. Assume resolved unless specified otherwise)*.
5. **EMG Waveform Visualization**: Waveform data visualization appears to be displaying placeholder/generated data instead of actual C3D file data. The `/api/v1/c3d/results/{result_id}/waveform` endpoint may need debugging to correctly extract and return real waveform data.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:

### C3D Processing API Structure:
- **Initial implementation**: API endpoints under `/api/v1/ghostly/upload`
- **Problem identified**: Mismatch between frontend API client paths and backend router prefix
- **Solution**: 
  - Renamed router prefix from `/api/v1/ghostly` to `/api/v1/c3d` for clearer domain separation
  - Removed duplicate `/api` prefixes in frontend API client
  - Added proper nginx location blocks for both `/api/` and `/v1/` paths
  - Created consistent API path structure across entire application

### Data Presentation in UX/UI Specifications (Therapist Persona):
- **Evolution**: The structure and numbering of data tables within the Therapist Persona section of `docs/00_PROJECT_DEFINITION/UX_UI_specifications.md` were refined.
- **Details**:
    - Key feature categories were logically reordered.
    - Data tables were renumbered sequentially (3.1.1 through 3.1.5) to align with the new feature order.
    - The former "Table 3.1.2: Intervention Adherence & Contextual Data" was removed, as its specific data points were deemed redundant or better integrated into other feature descriptions or general session notes, streamlining the documented data requirements.
    - Minor textual clarifications, like adding "- Main interface" to the Therapist persona overview, were incorporated.
- **Rationale**: To improve clarity, reduce redundancy, and ensure a more logical flow of information in the specifications guiding UI/UX development for the therapist interface.

### C3D Upload and EMG Analysis UI:
- **Initial implementation**: Basic file upload component with minimal options
- **Problem identified**: Need for more control over processing parameters and visualization options
- **Solution**:
  - Created dedicated `C3DUpload` component with advanced processing options
  - Developed separate `EMGAnalysisDisplay` component for visualization
  - Added dashboard card component for quick access
  - Implemented multiple access points (sessions page, patient page)
  - Designed for extensibility with different muscle groups

### Backend Dependency Management:
- **Initial implementation**: Basic Python dependencies for FastAPI
- **Problem identified**: Missing scientific libraries for C3D processing
- **Solution**:
  - Added numpy, pandas, ezc3d, matplotlib, scipy to pyproject.toml
  - Added build-essential, cmake, gcc, g++ to Dockerfile for compilation
  - Working on multi-stage Docker build to separate compilation from runtime

### Nginx Configuration Improvements:
- **Initial implementation**: Basic proxying for frontend, backend, and Supabase services
- **Problem identified**: 502 Bad Gateway errors when accessing the application
- **Solution**:
  - Used variables for upstream services with appropriate names
  - Disabled IPv6 in resolver configuration
  - Added detailed error handling for troubleshooting
  - Enabled larger request body size for file uploads
  - Used resolver variables consistently throughout the config

### Supabase Authentication Approach:
- **Initial implementation**: Used standard Supabase client for authentication
- **Problem identified**: Duplicate authentication headers (Authorization and apikey) causing 401 errors
- **Attempted solutions**:
  1. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Direct connection**: Updating Supabase URL to connect directly to port 8000 (bypassing Nginx) - CORS issues
  2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Nginx header management**: Configuring Nginx to strip Authorization header - Not effective with browser-generated requests
  3. ‚úÖ **Custom fetch implementation**: Bypassing Supabase client's auth methods for complete header control - Implementation complete
- **Current approach**: Custom fetch-based login function in authStore that only sends apikey header

### UI Component Styling Approach:
- **Initial implementation**: Used Shadcn UI Vue components with default Tailwind 4 configuration
- **Problem identified**: Component variants (especially buttons) not being detected correctly, all appearing black
- **Planned solutions** (Task #27):
  1. Review Tailwind 4 and Shadcn UI Vue integration, focusing on theme configuration
  2. Update color handling from HSL to OKLCH format where needed
  3. Ensure proper data-slot attributes on component primitives
  4. Refactor component code to use latest recommended variant styling patterns
  5. Test extensively to ensure consistent styling across all components

### **Frontend Framework Choice:**
- **Initial Choice**: Vue.js (`frontend`) selected for reactivity and component model.
- **First Switch**: Next.js/React (`frontend-2`).
  - **Rationale**: 
    - Leverage the broader React ecosystem and component libraries (like Shadcn UI, which has robust React support).
    - Utilize Next.js's integrated full-stack capabilities, including App Router, Server Components, Route Handlers (API routes), and built-in optimizations.
    - Address challenges encountered with specific Vue component library integrations.
- **Current Choice (May 14, 2025)**: Standard React with Vite
  - **Rationale**:
    - Next.js proved overly complex for our dashboard needs
    - React with Vite offers a lighter, more appropriate solution for our primarily client-side dashboard
    - Better alignment with project complexity and team skillset
    - Improved development speed with Vite's fast build times
- **Frontend Consolidation (May 17, 2025)**: Single React with Vite implementation in `frontend` directory
  - **Rationale**:
    - Eliminate code duplication and confusion between multiple frontend implementations
    - Simplify maintenance with a single codebase
    - Create clear organization by feature to improve developer experience
    - Remove technical debt from legacy Vue components and temporary Next.js transition code

### **Testing Strategy Decision:**
- **Decision (May 14, 2025)**: Adopted a **minimal but effective testing approach**.
  - **Rationale**: 
    - E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows (auth, data submission)
    - Backend unit tests with FastAPI TestClient for API validation
    - Simplified folder structure for maintainability
    - Focus on testing business-critical paths rather than exhaustive coverage

### **Backend Strategy Choice:**
- **Decision (May 17, 2025)**: Refined **Hybrid Backend Approach**.
  - **Rationale**: Utilize FastAPI for most backend services, Supabase Edge Functions for specific privileged/isolated tasks (like admin actions, transformations). Plan for a *separate* FastAPI service dedicated to future advanced Python analytics, keeping concerns separated.

   - MicroFET data integration requires additional validation

3. **User Interface**
   - Population-specific interfaces need more distinct visual indicators
   - Some complex analytics views are not yet optimized for mobile devices
   - USE questionnaire data entry form not yet implemented

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Focus vs. Current Direction

1. **Initial**: General muscle visualization for rehabilitation
   **Current**: Specific quadriceps muscle visualization with clinically relevant metrics

2. **Initial**: Generic patient management
   **Current**: Population-specific tracking with custom assessment tools

3. **Initial**: Basic EMG visualization
   **Current**: Advanced EMG analysis with training protocol markers

4. **Initial**: Single treatment approach
   **Current**: Three treatment arms comparison (Ghostly, Ghostly+BFR, Control)

5. **Initial**: Simple progress tracking
   **Current**: Time-point specific analysis (baseline, 2-week, 6-week)

### Recent Technical Decisions

1. **Decision**: Refactor visualization components to focus on quadriceps
   **Impact**: Better alignment with clinical trial focus, more relevant data visualization

2. **Decision**: Add treatment group filtering to all visualizations
   **Impact**: Enables direct comparison between the three study arms

3. **Decision**: Implement time-point specific views
   **Impact**: Clearer visualization of progress at the 2-week and 6-week measurement points

4. **Decision**: Create separate visualization types for different quadriceps measurements
   **Impact**: More accurate representation of the various clinical measurements

## Next Implementation Priorities

1. Complete the population-specific assessment visualizations
2. Implement the statistical analysis visualization components
3. Develop the USE questionnaire data collection and analysis features
4. Enhance the therapy compliance tracking system
5. Refine the muscle heatmap component for greater anatomical accuracy 

# Active Development Context

## Current Focus

We are currently working on **fixing API endpoint routing and file upload functionality** in the GHOSTLY+ Dashboard, specifically:

1. Resolving 502 Bad Gateway errors occurring when uploading C3D files
2. Aligning frontend API requests with backend endpoints
3. Configuring nginx properly to handle API requests
4. Ensuring all required backend dependencies for C3D processing are properly installed

We are also **refining the UI for the Patient Profile page, particularly the Clinical Assessments tab**, ensuring mock data is displayed correctly and styling is consistent.

## Recent Changes

### API Endpoint Restructuring (2025-05-24)
  - Renamed router prefix from `/api/v1/ghostly` to `/api/v1/c3d` for clearer domain separation
- Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
    -   Removed unused imports like `PlusCircle`.
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.

        - Fixed Docker configuration for ezc3d library dependencies using a single-stage build approach
        - Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries
        - Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
        - Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.

            -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    - **C3D Processing & EMG Analysis Components** (previous focus, largely stable):
        - Successfully fixed C3D file upload functionality by aligning API route prefixes
        - Fixed Docker configuration for ezc3d library dependencies using a single-stage build approach
        - Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries
        - Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
        - Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.

                -   Filtered measures to display only those with mock data.
                -   "Last Value" column removed.
                -   "Measure" column header aligned to the left.
            -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    - **C3D Processing & EMG Analysis Components** (previous focus, largely stable):
        - Successfully fixed C3D file upload functionality by aligning API route prefixes
        - Fixed Docker configuration for ezc3d library dependencies using a single-stage build approach
        - Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries
        - Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
        - Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.

                -   Table view implemented with colored badges for categories (with tooltips), "Measure", "Last Value" (later removed), and "Last Assessed" columns.
                -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) added to populate the table, with logic to display data or "N/A".
                -   Corrected mock data keys to match generated measure IDs (hyphens vs. underscores).
                -   Filtered measures to display only those with mock data.
                -   "Last Value" column removed.
                -   "Measure" column header aligned to the left.
            -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    - **C3D Processing & EMG Analysis Components** (previous focus, largely stable):
        - Successfully fixed C3D file upload functionality by aligning API route prefixes
        - Fixed Docker configuration for ezc3d library dependencies using a single-stage build approach
        - Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries
        - Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
        - Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.

            -   Initial implementation listed assessment categories.
            -   Iteratively improved UI:
                -   Card view with reduced padding and two-column grid for measures.
                -   Table view implemented with colored badges for categories (with tooltips), "Measure", "Last Value" (later removed), and "Last Assessed" columns.
                -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) added to populate the table, with logic to display data or "N/A".
                -   Corrected mock data keys to match generated measure IDs (hyphens vs. underscores).
                -   Filtered measures to display only those with mock data.
                -   "Last Value" column removed.
                -   "Measure" column header aligned to the left.
            -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    - **C3D Processing & EMG Analysis Components** (previous focus, largely stable):
        - Successfully fixed C3D file upload functionality by aligning API route prefixes
        - Fixed Docker configuration for ezc3d library dependencies using a single-stage build approach
        - Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries
        - Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
        - Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.

            -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
        -   In `ClinicalAssessments.tsx`:
            -   Component created in `frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`.
            -   Initial implementation listed assessment categories.
            -   Iteratively improved UI:
                -   Card view with reduced padding and two-column grid for measures.
                -   Table view implemented with colored badges for categories (with tooltips), "Measure", "Last Value" (later removed), and "Last Assessed" columns.
                -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) added to populate the table, with logic to display data or "N/A".
                -   Corrected mock data keys to match generated measure IDs (hyphens vs. underscores).
                -   Filtered measures to display only those with mock data.
                -   "Last Value" column removed.
                -   "Measure" column header aligned to the left.
            -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    - **C3D Processing & EMG Analysis Components** (previous focus, largely stable):
        - Successfully fixed C3D file upload functionality by aligning API route prefixes
        - Fixed Docker configuration for ezc3d library dependencies using a single-stage build approach
        - Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries
        - Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
        - Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.

            -   Tabs updated to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
            -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
            -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
            -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
        -   In `ClinicalAssessments.tsx`:
            -   Component created in `frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`.
            -   Initial implementation listed assessment categories.
            -   Iteratively improved UI:
                -   Card view with reduced padding and two-column grid for measures.
                -   Table view implemented with colored badges for categories (with tooltips), "Measure", "Last Value" (later removed), and "Last Assessed" columns.
                -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) added to populate the table, with logic to display data or "N/A".
                -   Corrected mock data keys to match generated measure IDs (hyphens vs. underscores).
                -   Filtered measures to display only those with mock data.
                -   "Last Value" column removed.
                -   "Measure" column header aligned to the left.
            -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    - **C3D Processing & EMG Analysis Components** (previous focus, largely stable):
        - Successfully fixed C3D file upload functionality by aligning API route prefixes
        - Fixed Docker configuration for ezc3d library dependencies using a single-stage build approach
        - Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries
        - Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
        - Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.

- **Recent Changes**:
    - **UI Enhancements for `PatientProfile.tsx` and `ClinicalAssessments.tsx`**:
        -   In `PatientProfile.tsx`:
            -   Tabs updated to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
            -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
            -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
            -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
        -   In `ClinicalAssessments.tsx`:
            -   Component created in `frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`.
            -   Initial implementation listed assessment categories.
            -   Iteratively improved UI:
                -   Card view with reduced padding and two-column grid for measures.
                -   Table view implemented with colored badges for categories (with tooltips), "Measure", "Last Value" (later removed), and "Last Assessed" columns.
                -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) added to populate the table, with logic to display data or "N/A".
                -   Corrected mock data keys to match generated measure IDs (hyphens vs. underscores).
                -   Filtered measures to display only those with mock data.
                -   "Last Value" column removed.
                -   "Measure" column header aligned to the left.
            -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    - **C3D Processing & EMG Analysis Components** (previous focus, largely stable):
        - Successfully fixed C3D file upload functionality by aligning API route prefixes
        - Fixed Docker configuration for ezc3d library dependencies using a single-stage build approach
        - Added system dependencies for runtime support of scientific libraries
        - Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
        - Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### Nginx Configuration Refinement (2025-05-24)
- Added proper location block for `/v1/` paths to proxy to backend
- Ensured consistent routing for all API endpoints

### UI Enhancements for Patient Profile & Clinical Assessments (2025-05-26)
-   **`PatientProfile.tsx`**:
    -   Tabs modified to "Sessions", "Clinical Assessments", "Notes". "Overview" tab and its content (e.g., `EmgVisualization`, `TreatmentTimeline`) were removed.
    -   "Clinical Assessments" tab now uses the new `ClinicalAssessments` component instead of `TreatmentConfig`.
    -   "Edit Assessment" button in the "Clinical Assessments" tab header changed to "Manage Assessments" (subsequently updated to "Add Assessment" and "View Progress" buttons).
    -   Tab styling ( `TabsList` and `TabsTrigger` in `PatientProfile.tsx`) updated to align with the styling in `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`, including icons (`Calendar`, `FileEdit`, `FilePlus`).
-   **`ClinicalAssessments.tsx`** (`frontend/src/components/patients/clinical-assessments.tsx`):
    -   Created as a new component.
    -   UI evolved from a simple list of assessment categories to a card-based layout, and finally to a table-based layout.
    -   The table displays columns for "Category" (using a colored `Badge` with a `Tooltip`), "Measure", and "Last Assessed". The "Last Value" column was removed.
    -   Mock data (`mockPatientAssessments`) was introduced and integrated to populate the table. The displayed data is filtered to only include measures for which mock data exists.
    -   Keys in `mockPatientAssessments` were corrected to use hyphens (e.g., `muscle-strength_0`) to match the dynamically generated measure IDs, resolving data display issues.
    -   The "Measure" column header is now left-aligned.
    -   Linter warnings (unused imports, `hasOwnProperty`) addressed.
    -   A message "No assessment data available." is shown if the filtered list of measures with mock data is empty.
