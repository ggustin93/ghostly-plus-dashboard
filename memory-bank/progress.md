2. ✅ **Local development environment** via Docker Compose with hot-reloading for frontend and backend.
3. ✅ **Local Supabase instance** running on Docker (M1-compatible) with required services (database, auth, storage, etc.).
4. ✅ **NGINX configuration** properly proxying requests to frontend, backend, and Supabase services.
5. ✅ **Storage buckets** created in Supabase for different data categories (c3d-files, avatars, reports, temp-...).
6. ✅ **Auth API verification** with successful backend authentication via direct API requests (`curl`).
7. ✅ **Authentication system now working properly** (as of May 9, 2025)
  - Supabase authentication through Nginx proxy resolved
  - Custom fetch implementation in authStore bypasses Supabase client header issues
  - Simplified Nginx configuration for auth endpoints

- ✅ Basic login UI implemented (`AuthForm.tsx` in `frontend-2`).
- ✅ Auth Context API for state management (`AuthContext.tsx` in `frontend-2`).
- ✅ Login/Account pages with routing protection implemented in `frontend-2`.
- ✅ Resolved module resolution issues related to dependencies in `frontend-2`.
- ⏳ *Previous Vue (`frontend`) auth implementation efforts are archived.* 
- ⏳ Next: Implement Admin page, RBAC, Password Reset, Registration (if applicable).

## Known Issues:

1. **Docker Stability**: Occasional issues with Docker restarts, may require system reboot to resolve. *(Seems less frequent now?)*
2. **Frontend (`frontend-2`)**: Need to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) checks for admin page.
3. **UI Component Styling**: *(Verify if Tailwind 4 / Shadcn UI issues from Vue project persist in Next.js/React setup. Assume resolved unless specified otherwise)*.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:

### Supabase Authentication Approach:
- **Initial implementation**: Used standard Supabase client for authentication
- **Problem identified**: Duplicate authentication headers (Authorization and apikey) causing 401 errors
- **Attempted solutions**:
  1. ⚠️ **Direct connection**: Updating Supabase URL to connect directly to port 8000 (bypassing Nginx) - CORS issues
  2. ⚠️ **Nginx header management**: Configuring Nginx to strip Authorization header - Not effective with browser-generated requests
  3. ✅ **Custom fetch implementation**: Bypassing Supabase client's auth methods for complete header control - Implementation complete
- **Current approach**: Custom fetch-based login function in authStore that only sends apikey header

### UI Component Styling Approach:
- **Initial implementation**: Used Shadcn UI Vue components with default Tailwind 4 configuration
- **Problem identified**: Component variants (especially buttons) not being detected correctly, all appearing black
- **Planned solutions** (Task #27):
  1. Review Tailwind 4 and Shadcn UI Vue integration, focusing on theme configuration
  2. Update color handling from HSL to OKLCH format where needed
  3. Ensure proper data-slot attributes on component primitives
  4. Refactor component code to use latest recommended variant styling patterns
  5. Test extensively to ensure consistent styling across all components

### **Frontend Framework Choice:**
- **Initial Choice**: Vue.js (`frontend`) selected for reactivity and component model.
- **First Switch**: Next.js/React (`frontend-2`).
  - **Rationale**: 
    - Leverage the broader React ecosystem and component libraries (like Shadcn UI, which has robust React support).
    - Utilize Next.js's integrated full-stack capabilities, including App Router, Server Components, Route Handlers (API routes), and built-in optimizations.
    - Address challenges encountered with specific Vue component library integrations.
- **Current Choice (May 14, 2025)**: Standard React with Vite
  - **Rationale**:
    - Next.js proved overly complex for our dashboard needs
    - React with Vite offers a lighter, more appropriate solution for our primarily client-side dashboard
    - Better alignment with project complexity and team skillset
    - Improved development speed with Vite's fast build times
- **Frontend Consolidation (May 17, 2025)**: Single React with Vite implementation in `frontend` directory
  - **Rationale**:
    - Eliminate code duplication and confusion between multiple frontend implementations
    - Simplify maintenance with a single codebase
    - Create clear organization by feature to improve developer experience
    - Remove technical debt from legacy Vue components and temporary Next.js transition code

### **Testing Strategy Decision:**
- **Decision (May 14, 2025)**: Adopted a **minimal but effective testing approach**.
  - **Rationale**: 
    - E2E tests with Playwright for critical user flows (auth, data submission)
    - Backend unit tests with FastAPI TestClient for API validation
    - Simplified folder structure for maintainability
    - Focus on testing business-critical paths rather than exhaustive coverage

### **Backend Strategy Choice:**
- **Decision (May 17, 2025)**: Refined **Hybrid Backend Approach**.
  - **Rationale**: Utilize FastAPI for most backend services, Supabase Edge Functions for specific privileged/isolated tasks (like admin actions, transformations). Plan for a *separate* FastAPI service dedicated to future advanced Python analytics, keeping concerns separated.
