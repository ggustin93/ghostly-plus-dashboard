# GHOSTLY+ Dashboard: Project Progress

## What Works:

### Infrastructure and Setup:
1. ✅ **Complete project scaffolding** with Docker, Poetry (backend), Vite/Vue 3/TypeScript (frontend), Supabase, and NGINX reverse proxy.
2. ✅ **Local development environment** via Docker Compose with hot-reloading for frontend and backend.
3. ✅ **Local Supabase instance** running on Docker (M1-compatible) with required services (database, auth, storage, etc.).
4. ✅ **NGINX configuration** properly proxying requests to frontend, backend, and Supabase services.
5. ✅ **Storage buckets** created in Supabase for different data categories (c3d-files, avatars, reports, temp-...).
6. ✅ **Auth API verification** with successful backend authentication via direct API requests (`curl`).
7. ✅ **Authentication system now working properly** (as of May 9, 2025)
  - Supabase authentication through Nginx proxy resolved
  - Custom fetch implementation in authStore bypasses Supabase client header issues
  - Simplified Nginx configuration for auth endpoints
  - Detailed documentation added in `docs/supabase-auth-fix.md`

### Features and Components:
1. ✅ **Base UI components** (shadcn-vue) installed and configured.
2. ✅ **Authentication UI** created with login form using shadcn-vue components.
3. ✅ **Pinia store** for authentication state management.

### Documentation:
1. ✅ **Development workflow** documentation established.
2. ✅ **Environment setup guides** created for local CLI development and VM self-hosted Supabase.
3. ✅ **API and security configuration** documented in detail.
4. ✅ **Memory Bank** established for contextual documentation.

## What's Left to Build:

### Phase 3: Authentication and Authorization System (In Progress)

2. 🔄 Implement user progress synchronization.
3. 🔄 Develop game session management.

### Phase 7: Advanced Features
1. 🔄 Implement data export functionality.
2. 🔄 Create therapist annotation tools.
3. 🔄 Develop patient progress tracking.

### Phase 8: Testing and Optimization
1. 🔄 Set up automated testing framework.
2. 🔄 Perform security audit.
3. 🔄 Optimize performance.
4. 🔄 Conduct user acceptance testing.

### Phase 9: Deployment and Documentation
1. 🔄 Create deployment scripts.
2. 🔄 Prepare user and administrator documentation.
3. 🔄 Develop maintenance procedures.

## Project Status & Progress Notes:

### Task 1: Project Setup and Repository Configuration
- ✅ **COMPLETED**
- Created repository structure with appropriate .gitignore, LICENSE, and README.
- Set up Docker configuration for development environment.
- Configured Poetry for backend dependency management.
- Established frontend project with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite.
- Set up Supabase for local development.
- Configured NGINX as reverse proxy.
- Updated ESLint to v9 with flat config structure.
- Applied proper formatting with Prettier (frontend) and Ruff (backend).

### Task 2: Local Development Environment
- ✅ Subtask 2.1: **COMPLETED** - Set up local development environment
- ✅ Subtask 2.2: **COMPLETED** - Deploy local Supabase services
- ✅ Subtask 2.3: **COMPLETED** - Configure local API and security
  - Successfully configured CORS for Supabase services
  - Created storage buckets for different data types
  - Resolved M1 Mac compatibility issues
  - Established proper JWT configuration for secure authentication

### Task 3: Authentication and Authorization System
- ⏳ **IN PROGRESS**
- ✅ Supabase authentication backend configured and tested
- ✅ Basic login UI implemented with shadcn-vue components
- ✅ Pinia store for authentication state management created
- ✅ Authentication debugging & resolution implemented:
  - 🔍 **Problem diagnosed**: Browser sends duplicate authentication headers (`Authorization: Bearer <anon_key>` and `apikey: <anon_key>`) causing GoTrue to reject login requests
  - ✅ **Solution implemented**: Created custom fetch-based authentication implementation that:
    1. Bypasses Supabase client's signIn method completely
    2. Uses direct fetch API with controlled headers (only apikey, no Authorization)
    3. Processes authentication response and updates Supabase client with received tokens
    4. Leverages existing session management once authentication is complete
  - ⚠️ Solution testing interrupted by Docker issues requiring system restart

## Known Issues:

1. **Docker Stability**: Occasional issues with Docker restarts, may require system reboot to resolve.
2. **Authentication Flow**: Custom implementation complete but not yet verified working due to Docker restart issues.
3. **Frontend Auth Persistence**: Need to integrate router navigation guards and session persistence after authentication is verified.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:

### Supabase Authentication Approach:
- **Initial implementation**: Used standard Supabase client for authentication
- **Problem identified**: Duplicate authentication headers (Authorization and apikey) causing 401 errors
- **Attempted solutions**:
  1. ⚠️ **Direct connection**: Updating Supabase URL to connect directly to port 8000 (bypassing Nginx) - CORS issues
  2. ⚠️ **Nginx header management**: Configuring Nginx to strip Authorization header - Not effective with browser-generated requests
  3. ✅ **Custom fetch implementation**: Bypassing Supabase client's auth methods for complete header control - Implementation complete
- **Current approach**: Custom fetch-based login function in authStore that only sends apikey header

## Project Decision Timeline:

### 2025-05-05
- Decided to use Docker Compose for local development environment
- Selected Poetry for backend dependency management
- Chose Vue 3 with TypeScript and Vite for frontend

- Implemented NGINX as reverse proxy
- Selected Apache 2.0 as placeholder license (pending TTO consultation)

### 2025-05-06
- Established folder structure and Docker configuration
- Set up backend with FastAPI
- Created frontend with Vue 3 and shadcn-vue components
- Configured Supabase services with Docker Compose

### 2025-05-07

### 2025-05-09
- Diagnosed and fixed authentication issues:
  - Identified header management issues with Nginx proxy
  - Implemented direct Supabase connection for auth operations
  - Modified Supabase client configuration to prevent automatic header management
  - Updated Nginx configuration to explicitly remove Authorization header for auth endpoints
  - Documented two viable architectural approaches for authentication flow

## Next Actions:
