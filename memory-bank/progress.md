# GHOSTLY+ Dashboard: Progress Log

## Current Overall Status: Phase 1 - Infrastructure Setup (Task 1 in progress)

- **Date**: 2025-05-06

## What Works / Completed Milestones

-   Initial project documentation (`docs/prd.md`, `docs/task-summary.md`, `docs/security.md`) reviewed.
-   Decision made to include optional 2FA/MFA; relevant documents and Taskmaster task (ID 3) updated.
-   Memory Bank core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) created with initial content.
-   **Subtask 1.1: Initialize Git Repository and Base Project Structure COMPLETED**
    -   Git repository initialized with `backend/`, `frontend/`, `nginx/`, `docs/` structure.
    -   `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` created.
    -   Comprehensive `.gitignore` configured.
    -   Placeholder `LICENSE` (Apache 2.0) added.
    -   Taskmaster task #26 created for VUB TTO license consultation.
    -   Initial commit of base structure made.
-   **Subtask 1.2: Configure Backend Environment with FastAPI COMPLETED**
    -   Poetry initialized in `backend/` with FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy.
    -   Basic `backend/app/` structure created (`main.py`, `api/`, `models/`).
    -   `backend/README.md` added.
    -   `backend/.env.example` and `backend/.env` set up.
    -   FastAPI `/health` endpoint implemented and verified.

## What's Left to Build / Immediate Next Steps

-   **Currently working on Subtask 1.3: Set Up Frontend with Vue.js 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.**
-   Complete remaining subtasks for Task 1 (Project Setup and Repository Configuration):
    -   1.4: Create Docker Configuration for Backend and Frontend
    -   1.5: Configure Nginx as Reverse Proxy
    -   1.6: Finalize Development Environment Configuration
-   Thorough review of all Memory Bank files against recent progress.
-   Address open questions in `docs/prd.md` (Section 8).
-   Continue with Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup tasks.

## Known Issues / Blockers

-   Global Git ignore settings on user's machine initially prevented creation of `.env.example` files; workaround was manual creation by user. This is not a project blocker but a local environment note.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

-   **[Date of 2FA discussion]**: Decided to implement 2FA/MFA as an optional feature.
-   **2025-05-06**: Selected Apache 2.0 as a placeholder license, pending VUB TTO consultation (Task #26).
