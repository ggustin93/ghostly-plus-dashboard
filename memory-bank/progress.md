# GHOSTLY+ Dashboard: Project Progress

## What Works:

### Infrastructure and Setup:
1. ✅ **Complete project scaffolding** with Docker, Poetry (backend), Vite/Vue 3/TypeScript (frontend), Supabase, and NGINX reverse proxy.
2. ✅ **Local development environment** via Docker Compose with hot-reloading for frontend and backend.
3. ✅ **Local Supabase instance** running on Docker (M1-compatible) with required services (database, auth, storage, etc.).
4. ✅ **NGINX configuration** properly proxying requests to frontend, backend, and Supabase services.
5. ✅ **Storage buckets** created in Supabase for different data categories (c3d-files, avatars, reports, temp-...).
6. ✅ **Auth API verification** with successful backend authentication via direct API requests (`curl`).
7. ✅ **Authentication system now working properly** (as of May 9, 2025)
  - Supabase authentication through Nginx proxy resolved
  - Custom fetch implementation in authStore bypasses Supabase client header issues
  - Simplified Nginx configuration for auth endpoints
  - Detailed documentation added in `docs/supabase-auth-fix.md`

### Features and Components (`frontend-2` - Next.js):
1. ✅ Base UI components (shadcn/ui for React) installed and configured.
2. ✅ Authentication UI (`AuthForm.tsx`) created using shadcn/ui components.
3. ✅ Auth Context API (`AuthContext.tsx`) for authentication state management.
4. ✅ Login Page (`/login`) with redirection logic.
5. ✅ Account Page (`/account`) displaying basic user info and logout.
6. ✅ Root Page (`/`) protected, redirects to `/login` or `/account` based on auth state.

*(Previous Vue (`frontend`) components are now archived/obsolete)*

### Documentation:
1. ✅ **Development workflow** documentation established.
2. ✅ **Environment setup guides** created for local CLI development and VM self-hosted Supabase.
3. ✅ **API and security configuration** documented in detail.
4. ✅ **Memory Bank** established for contextual documentation.

- ✅ Basic login UI implemented (`AuthForm.tsx` in `frontend-2`).
- ✅ Auth Context API for state management (`AuthContext.tsx` in `frontend-2`).
- ✅ Login/Account pages with routing protection implemented in `frontend-2`.

- ⏳ Next: Implement Admin page, RBAC, Password Reset, Registration (if applicable).

## Known Issues:

1. **Docker Stability**: Occasional issues with Docker restarts, may require system reboot to resolve. *(Seems less frequent now?)*
2. **Frontend (`frontend-2`)**: Need to implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) checks for admin page.
3. **UI Component Styling**: *(Verify if Tailwind 4 / Shadcn UI issues from Vue project persist in Next.js/React setup. Assume resolved unless specified otherwise)*.

## Evolution of Project Decisions:

### Supabase Authentication Approach:
- **Initial implementation**: Used standard Supabase client for authentication
- **Problem identified**: Duplicate authentication headers (Authorization and apikey) causing 401 errors
- **Attempted solutions**:
  1. ⚠️ **Direct connection**: Updating Supabase URL to connect directly to port 8000 (bypassing Nginx) - CORS issues
  2. ⚠️ **Nginx header management**: Configuring Nginx to strip Authorization header - Not effective with browser-generated requests
  3. ✅ **Custom fetch implementation**: Bypassing Supabase client's auth methods for complete header control - Implementation complete
- **Current approach**: Custom fetch-based login function in authStore that only sends apikey header

### UI Component Styling Approach:
- **Initial implementation**: Used Shadcn UI Vue components with default Tailwind 4 configuration
- **Problem identified**: Component variants (especially buttons) not being detected correctly, all appearing black
- **Planned solutions** (Task #27):
  1. Review Tailwind 4 and Shadcn UI Vue integration, focusing on theme configuration
  2. Update color handling from HSL to OKLCH format where needed
  3. Ensure proper data-slot attributes on component primitives
  4. Refactor component code to use latest recommended variant styling patterns
  5. Test extensively to ensure consistent styling across all components

### **Frontend Framework Choice:**
- **Initial Choice**: Vue.js (`frontend`) selected for reactivity and component model.
- **Switch Decision ([Current Date])**: Switched to **Next.js/React (`frontend-2`)**.
  - **Rationale**: 
    - Leverage the broader React ecosystem and component libraries (like Shadcn UI, which has robust React support).
    - Utilize Next.js's integrated full-stack capabilities, including App Router, Server Components, Route Handlers (API routes), and built-in optimizations (image optimization, etc.).
    - Align with potential team familiarity or preference for the React/Next.js stack (verify if needed).
    - Simplify routing and server-side rendering/fetching patterns compared to implementing them separately with Vue.
    - Address challenges encountered with specific Vue component library integrations (e.g., Shadcn UI Vue styling issues).

### **Backend Strategy Choice:**
- **Decision ([Current Date])**: Adopted a **Hybrid Backend Approach**.
  - **Rationale**: Utilize Next.js server-side features for standard web backend tasks integrated with the frontend. Use Supabase Edge Functions for specific privileged/isolated tasks (like admin actions, transformations). Plan for a *separate* FastAPI service dedicated to future advanced Python analytics, keeping concerns separated.

## Next Actions:

1.  Create Supabase Edge Function (`get-all-users`) for admin page user fetching.
2.  Build `/admin` page in `frontend-2` to display users (using Shadcn Table).
3.  Implement RBAC check for accessing `/admin` page.
4.  Continue with other pending tasks (Password Reset, Registration, Dashboard Layout etc. in `frontend-2`).
5.  Review/update other docs (README, PRD) for framework change.
