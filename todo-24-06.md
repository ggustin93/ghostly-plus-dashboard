Subject: UX Rationale & Developer Context for the Upcoming Therapist Prototype
Hi Team,
First off, great work getting the foundational elements of the dashboard in place. Our next major milestone is preparing a high-fidelity prototype for our upcoming meeting with the clinical therapy team. This meeting is our single most important opportunity to validate our design assumptions and ensure we're building a tool that therapists will actually want to use.
The goal of this development sprint is not to build functional backend features. Instead, it's to create a convincing, clickable frontend prototype that tells a clear story. We want the therapist to immediately grasp the value of this dashboard in their daily workflow.
To that end, the following plan is designed around a core UX principle: Shifting from a "Data Repository" to an "Actionable Triage Station."
A therapist's primary challenge is not a lack of data, but a lack of time. They need to quickly answer the question: "Which of my patients needs my attention the most right now, and why?" Our previous design showed them data; this new design will guide their focus.
Hereâ€™s the UX thinking behind each part of the plan:
1. The Main Dashboard: The 30-Second Triage
This page must be the therapist's mission control. They should be able to look at it for 30 seconds and know the health of their entire caseload.
Why redesign the SummaryCards?
We're replacing "Upcoming Sessions" with "Patients with Alerts". This is a critical shift from showing inventory to showing urgency. The orange accent color is intentional to create a subtle "warning" signal that draws the eye.
Why create the PriorityPatients component?
This is the heart of the "triage" concept. Instead of forcing the therapist to scan a long list and look for problems, we are proactively surfacing the top 5 patients who are falling behind. Displaying the reason for the alert ("Low Performance," "Missed Sessions") gives them immediate context for action.
The "positive empty state" ("âœ… All patients are on track.") is psychologically important. It provides reassurance and a sense of accomplishment, turning the absence of problems into a positive feedback loop.
Why create the RecentActivity feed?
This provides passive awareness. It allows the therapist to feel the "pulse" of their caseload without actively seeking information. The color-coded performance dots (ðŸŸ¢ðŸŸ¡ðŸ”´) allow for rapid visual scanning, helping them spot trends or recent changes at a glance.
2. Lists & Profiles: From Data Points to Narratives
We are evolving our tables and patient profiles to tell a story of progress over time, not just show static data.
Why update the PatientList?
Adding "Adherence" and "Progress" columns transforms the list from a simple directory into a high-level health summary. A therapist can now scan the list and immediately identify patients who are both compliant and improving versus those who are struggling, without clicking into each profile. This dramatically reduces their cognitive load.
Why update the SessionsList?
Removing "Status" declutters the UI. Since all sessions are patient-led and we're looking at a historical log, every listed session is implicitly "completed." This is removing unnecessary noise.
Adding "Performance" with color-coding provides instant, scannable feedback on the outcome of each session, making the list far more valuable.
Why redesign the PatientProfile page?
Removing "Clinical Assessments" for this prototype is a strategic choice. It focuses the therapist's feedback on the data the GHOSTLY+ system itself generates. We want to perfect our presentation of performance, adherence, and game data first.
Adding the "Progress Tracking" tab is the most significant change. Therapists think in terms of trends. A single data point is information; a chart is a story. By showing historical charts for performance, adherence, compliance, game score, and fatigue, we allow the therapist to see the patient's entire journey, making it easy to spot plateaus, improvements, or declines. This is the evidence they need to make clinical decisions.
3. Navigation & Flow: Creating a Seamless Experience
Why hide the "C3D Files" link?
This is a "researcher-focused" artifact. For the therapist's core workflow of monitoring and guiding patients, it's irrelevant technical detail. Hiding it keeps the prototype clean and focused on their primary tasks.
Why is the click-through crucial?
Making the dashboard items link to the profile/session pagesâ€”even if those pages are just static mockups for nowâ€”is what makes this a prototype instead of a picture. It allows the therapist to experience the intended user flow, which is essential for gathering meaningful feedback on navigation and information architecture.
Our goal is to walk into this meeting with a prototype that feels intuitive, intelligent, and designed specifically for a busy therapist. By focusing on these details, we're not just building a UI; we're demonstrating a deep understanding of our user's needs.
Let's build a prototype that makes them say, "Yes, this will make my job easier."
### **Final UI Prototype Action Plan: Therapist Meeting**

**Objective:** To implement a high-fidelity, clickable frontend prototype that demonstrates the core therapist workflow. This plan focuses exclusively on UI changes using mocked data.

---

### **Phase 0: Prerequisite Data Scaffolding**

*Before building UI, we must update our data structures to support the new views.*

*   [ ] **Task:** Update the Patient data model and mock data.
    *   **File to Modify:** `frontend/src/types/patient.ts`
    *   **Action:** Add new fields to the `Patient` interface for adherence, progress, and historical data for charts.

      ```typescript
      export interface Patient {
        // ... existing fields
        adherence?: number; // Example: 95
        progress?: 'improving' | 'steady' | 'declining';
        // Add history arrays for the new charts
        performanceHistory?: { date: string; value: number }[];
        adherenceHistory?: { date: string; value: number }[];
        complianceHistory?: { date: string; value: number }[];
        gameScoreHistory?: { date: string; value: number }[];
        fatigueHistory?: { date: string; value: number }[];
      }
      ```
    *   **File to Modify:** `frontend/src/data/patients-data.ts`
    *   **Action:** For at least 3-4 patients in the `mockPatients` array, populate the new fields. Ensure a variety of progress states and create sample historical data arrays.

---

### **Phase 1: High-Impact UI Implementation**

#### **1.1. Main Dashboard Redesign (`frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`)**

*   [ ] **Task: Rework the `SummaryCards` Component.**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Keep the existing `Active Patients` card.
        2.  Create a new `<Card>` for **"Patients with Alerts."**
            *   **Styling:** Use a distinct visual cue, like an orange border: `<Card className="border-orange-500/50">`.
            *   **Icon:** Use the `lucide-react` `AlertTriangle` icon with a matching color: `<AlertTriangle className="h-4 w-4 text-orange-500" />`.
        3.  Create a new `<Card>` for **"Adherence Rate (Last 7d)."**
    *   **Mock Data:** Use static numbers for the prototype (e.g., "3 Alerts", "82% Adherence").

*   [ ] **Task: Implement the `PriorityPatients` Triage Component.**
    *   **File:** Create a new component at `frontend/src/components/dashboard/priority-patient-list.tsx`.
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Add a `<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Priority Patients to Review</h3>`.
        2.  Create a reusable `PatientAlertItem` sub-component within the file. It should be a `<Link>` component from `react-router-dom` navigating to `/patients/:id`.
        3.  The `PatientAlertItem` should display an `Avatar`, `Patient Name`, and the alert reason with an associated icon (e.g., `<ArrowDownCircle className="h-4 w-4 text-red-500" /> <span>Low Performance</span>`).
        4.  In `dashboard/index.tsx`, import `PriorityPatientList` and pass it a static array of 3-4 mock alert objects.
        5.  **Empty State:** The component should conditionally render a positive message if the passed array is empty: `<div>âœ… All patients are on track.</div>`.

*   [ ] **Task: Implement the `RecentActivity` Feed.**
    *   **File:** Create a new component at `frontend/src/components/dashboard/recent-activity-feed.tsx`.
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Add a title: `<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Recent Session Activity</h3>`.
        2.  Create a `SessionActivityItem` sub-component that is a `<Link>` to the specific session analysis page (`/sessions/:id`).
        3.  Display `[Date] - [Patient Name]` and a performance score with a color-coded dot using `Badge` for consistency: `<Badge className="bg-green-100 text-green-700">98%</Badge>`.
        4.  In `dashboard/index.tsx`, import `RecentActivityFeed` and pass it a static array of mock session objects.

#### **1.2. Core Component & Page Adjustments**

*   [ ] **Task: Update the Patient List Table (`patient-list.tsx`).**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/components/dashboard/patient-list.tsx`
    *   **Action:**
        1.  Add `<TableHead>Adherence</TableHead>` and `<TableHead>Progress</TableHead>`.
        2.  In the `map` function, add two new `<TableCell>`s for each patient row:
            *   **Adherence Cell:** `<TableCell><Badge variant="outline">{patient.adherence}%</Badge></TableCell>`
            *   **Progress Cell:** Use conditional rendering for the icon and badge based on `patient.progress`.
                ```tsx
                <TableCell>
                  <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
                    {patient.progress === 'improving' && <ArrowUp className="h-4 w-4 text-green-500" />}
                    {/* ... other conditions for steady/declining */}
                    <Badge variant="static" className={/*...conditional classes...*/}>
                      {patient.progress}
                    </Badge>
                  </div>
                </TableCell>
                ```

*   [ ] **Task: Update the Sessions List Table (`sessions-list.tsx`).**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/components/patients/sessions-list.tsx`
    *   **Action:**
        1.  **Remove** the "Status" `<TableHead>` and corresponding `<TableCell>`. Also remove any related `useState` for status filtering.
        2.  **Add** a new `<TableHead>Performance</TableHead>`.
        3.  In the `TableRow` map, add a new `<TableCell>` for performance.
        4.  Implement logic to apply conditional classes to a `Badge` component for the color-coding.
            ```tsx
            const score = parseInt(session.performance || '0');
            let badgeClass = 'bg-red-100 text-red-700 border-red-300';
            if (score > 80) badgeClass = 'bg-green-100 text-green-700 border-green-300';
            else if (score >= 60) badgeClass = 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-700 border-yellow-300';

            <TableCell>
              <Badge variant="static" className={`${badgeClass} dark:bg-opacity-30`}>
                {session.performance}
              </Badge>
            </TableCell>
            ```

*   [ ] **Task: Redesign the Patient Profile Page (`patient-profile.tsx`).**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/pages/patients/patient-profile.tsx`
    *   **Action:**
        1.  In the `<Tabs>` component, find and **remove** the `TabsTrigger` and `TabsContent` for "Clinical Assessments."
        2.  **Add** a new `<TabsTrigger value="progress-tracking"><BarChart className="mr-2 h-4 w-4" />Progress Tracking</TabsTrigger>`.
        3.  Add a new `<TabsContent value="progress-tracking">` and render the new `ProgressTrackingCharts` component inside it: `<ProgressTrackingCharts patient={patient} />`.

*   [ ] **Task: Create the Progress Tracking Component.**
    *   **File:** Create `frontend/src/components/patients/progress-tracking-charts.tsx`.
    *   **Action:**
        1.  The component should accept `patient: Patient` as a prop.
        2.  Create a responsive grid: `<div className="grid grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2 gap-6">`.
        3.  For each of the 5 required metrics, create a `<Card>` containing a `recharts` `LineChart`.
        4.  Use the `...History` arrays from the mock patient object as the `data` prop for each chart.

#### **1.3. Navigation & Final Polish**

*   [ ] **Task: Simplify Sidebar for Therapist Prototype.**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/components/layouts/sidebar.tsx`
    *   **Action:** Find the nav item for "C3D Files" and either comment it out or wrap it in a condition to hide it.
*   [ ] **Task: Remove Obsolete Dashboard Calendar.**
    *   **File:** `frontend/src/pages/dashboard/index.tsx`
    *   **Action:** Remove the "Weekly Schedule" tab and its entire content block.
*   [ ] **Task: Test the Clickable Flow.**
    *   **Action:** Manually navigate the prototype to ensure all new links work as intended. A click on a `PriorityPatient` item or a `RecentActivity` item should lead to the correct page, even if that page is not fully detailed yet. This demonstrates the intended user journey.
