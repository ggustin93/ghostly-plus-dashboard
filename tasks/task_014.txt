# Task ID: 14
# Title: Data Encryption and Pseudonymization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data and patient identifier pseudonymization to ensure GDPR compliance and data privacy.
# Details:
1. Design encryption strategy:
   - Select appropriate encryption algorithms (e.g., Fernet for symmetric encryption)
   - Define key management approach
   - Identify data fields requiring encryption
2. Implement pseudonymization system:
   - Generate unique pseudonyms for patient identifiers
   - Create secure linking mechanism
   - Implement reversible pseudonymization for authorized users
3. Develop encryption/decryption services:
   - Key generation and storage
   - Data encryption/decryption utilities
   - Integration with database operations
4. Implement secure key management:
   - Key rotation policies
   - Secure key storage
   - Access control for keys
5. Add audit logging for all encryption/decryption operations
6. Create utilities for data anonymization for research exports
7. Document encryption approach and security measures

# Test Strategy:
- Test encryption/decryption functionality
- Verify pseudonymization is effective
- Test key rotation and management
- Validate audit logging for security operations
- Test data anonymization for exports
- Verify authorized access to encrypted data
- Security review of implementation
