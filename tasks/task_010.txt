# Task ID: 10
# Title: EMG Data Visualization Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop frontend components for visualizing EMG signals, muscle strength analysis, contraction detection, and fatigue analysis.
# Details:
1. Research and select appropriate charting libraries (Chart.js or D3.js)
2. Develop reusable visualization components:
   - Temporal EMG signal graphs
   - Muscle strength analysis charts
   - Contraction detection visualization
   - Fatigue analysis graphs
   - Session comparison views
3. Implement data processing utilities:
   - Signal filtering and normalization
   - Feature extraction
   - Statistical calculations
4. Create interactive features:
   - Zoom and pan functionality
   - Time range selection
   - Annotation capabilities
   - Export to image/PDF
5. Optimize rendering performance for large datasets
6. Ensure responsive design for different screen sizes
7. Implement accessibility features (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

# Test Strategy:
- Test visualization components with sample EMG data
- Verify interactive features work correctly
- Test performance with large datasets
- Validate responsive behavior on different devices
- Test accessibility with screen readers
- Verify data processing accuracy
- User testing with therapists for usability feedback
