# Task ID: 11
# Title: Game Performance Analysis Components
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop frontend components for analyzing and visualizing game performance metrics, session duration, frequency, and correlation with EMG activity.
# Details:
1. Design and implement game performance visualization components:
   - Score progression charts
   - Session duration and frequency graphs
   - Level completion statistics
   - Performance trend analysis
2. Create correlation analysis components:
   - EMG activity vs. game performance
   - Muscle fatigue vs. game scores
   - Progress over time visualizations
3. Implement filtering and comparison tools:
   - Date range selection
   - Session comparison
   - Patient comparison
4. Add export functionality for analysis results
5. Ensure responsive design and accessibility
6. Optimize for performance with large datasets

# Test Strategy:
- Test visualization components with sample game data
- Verify correlation analysis accuracy
- Test filtering and comparison functionality
- Validate export features
- Test responsive behavior
- Verify accessibility compliance
- User testing with therapists and researchers
