# Task ID: 18
# Title: Advanced EMG Analytics Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop advanced EMG signal analysis features including muscle fatigue analysis, strength progression tracking, and comparative analytics.
# Details:
1. Research and implement advanced EMG analysis algorithms:
   - Muscle fatigue detection and quantification
   - Strength progression metrics
   - Contraction quality assessment
   - Pattern recognition in EMG signals
2. Develop visualization components for advanced metrics:
   - Fatigue index charts
   - Strength progression graphs
   - Contraction quality visualizations
   - Comparative analysis views
3. Create analysis configuration tools:
   - Parameter adjustment
   - Algorithm selection
   - Baseline configuration
4. Implement batch processing for historical data
5. Add export functionality for analysis results
6. Create documentation for analysis methodologies
7. Develop interpretation guides for therapists

# Test Strategy:
- Test analysis algorithms with sample EMG data
- Verify visualization components
- Validate calculation accuracy
- Test batch processing performance
- Expert review of analysis methodologies
- User testing with therapists and researchers
- Test export functionality
