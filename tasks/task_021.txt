# Task ID: 21
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 16, 17
# Priority: low
# Description: Optimize application performance to meet requirements for page load times, simultaneous users, and efficient processing of large C3D files.
# Details:
1. Conduct performance audit of frontend and backend
2. Implement frontend optimizations:
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Asset optimization (images, fonts, etc.)
   - Component virtualization for large lists
   - Memoization of expensive calculations
   - Efficient state management
3. Optimize backend performance:
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching strategies (Redis or similar)
   - Asynchronous processing for heavy tasks
   - API response optimization
4. Improve C3D file processing:
   - Streaming processing for large files
   - Parallel processing where applicable
   - Optimized algorithms for data extraction
5. Implement performance monitoring
6. Add load testing infrastructure
7. Document performance best practices

# Test Strategy:
- Benchmark page load times
- Test with simulated concurrent users
- Measure C3D processing performance
- Profile database query performance
- Load testing with realistic scenarios
- Verify performance on target devices
- Monitor memory usage and CPU utilization
