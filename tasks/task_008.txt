# Task ID: 8
# Title: OpenFeasyo Game Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Modify the OpenFeasyo game (C#/MonoGame) to implement Supabase authentication and direct C3D file upload to the backend API.
# Details:
1. Analyze the OpenFeasyo game codebase to identify integration points
2. Implement Supabase authentication in the game:
   - Add login screen or integration with existing UI
   - Implement REST API calls to Supabase Auth
   - Store and manage JWT tokens securely
3. Develop C3D file upload functionality:
   - Create a service to handle file uploads
   - Implement authenticated API calls to the backend
   - Add progress indication and error handling
4. Implement fallback mechanism for offline operation:
   - Store files locally when connection is unavailable
   - Queue for later upload when connection is restored
5. Add session metadata collection:
   - Capture therapist ID, patient ID, session parameters
   - Include metadata in C3D file or as separate payload
6. Test integration on Android tablets
7. Document integration for future maintenance

# Test Strategy:
- Test authentication flow in the game
- Verify C3D file generation and upload
- Test offline operation and sync
- Validate error handling and recovery
- Test on actual Android tablets
- Verify metadata is correctly associated with uploaded files
- Test with various network conditions
