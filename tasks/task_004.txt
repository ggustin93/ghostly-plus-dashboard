# Task ID: 4
# Title: Database Schema Design and Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the PostgreSQL database schema for patient data, EMG recordings, game metrics, and user management with proper relationships and constraints.
# Details:
1. Design comprehensive database schema including:
   - Users table (linked to Supabase Auth)
   - Patients table with demographic and medical data
   - Medical centers table
   - Therapist-patient relationships
   - Sessions table for recording therapy sessions
   - EMG data tables (processed data from C3D files)
   - Game metrics tables
   - Cohorts and cohort membership
2. Implement schema using SQL migrations:
   - Create tables with appropriate constraints
   - Set up foreign key relationships
   - Configure indexes for performance
3. Implement Row-Level Security (RLS) policies:
   - Therapists can only access their patients' data
   - Researchers can access data based on their center/study
   - Administrators have full access
4. Set up encryption for sensitive patient data using pgcrypto
5. Create database views for common queries
6. Document schema with entity-relationship diagrams

# Test Strategy:
- Validate schema with test data insertion
- Test foreign key constraints and cascading operations
- Verify RLS policies with different user roles
- Benchmark query performance for common operations
- Test encryption and decryption of sensitive data
- Verify data integrity constraints
