# Task ID: 25
# Title: User Testing and Feedback Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct user testing sessions with therapists and researchers, collect feedback, and implement improvements based on user input.
# Details:
1. Design user testing protocol:
   - Define testing scenarios
   - Create task lists for participants
   - Prepare feedback collection forms
   - Set up testing environment
2. Recruit test participants:
   - Therapists from participating centers
   - Researchers from the project team
   - Potential end users
3. Conduct testing sessions:
   - Round 1: Early prototype feedback (Week 10)
   - Round 2: Core functionality validation (Week 15)
   - Round 3: Final usability assessment (Week 19)
4. Analyze feedback and identify improvements:
   - Usability issues
   - Missing features
   - Workflow optimizations
   - Interface improvements
5. Prioritize and implement changes
6. Conduct follow-up testing to validate improvements
7. Document user testing results and implemented changes

# Test Strategy:
- Collect quantitative metrics (task completion time, success rate)
- Gather qualitative feedback (interviews, surveys)
- Test implemented changes with original participants
- Compare metrics before and after improvements
- Validate that critical issues are resolved
- Document remaining issues for future iterations
- Collect overall satisfaction ratings
