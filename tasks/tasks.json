Here's what was accomplished:\n\n1. Created `/nginx/Dockerfile` using the official Nginx image as a base and configured it to copy our custom configuration files.\n\n2. Set up `/nginx/conf.d/default.conf` with the following proxy configurations:\n   - Configured the main server block to listen on port 80\n   - Added location directives to properly route requests:\n     - Frontend requests to the frontend service\n     - API requests (/api) to the backend service\n   - Set appropriate proxy headers (Host, X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-For, etc.)\n   - Included basic security headers\n\n3. Updated `docker-compose.yml` with a new nginx service:\n   - Exposed port 80 to the host machine\n   - Created links to both backend and frontend services\n   - Added volume mounts for the Nginx configuration files\n   - Ensured proper networking between services\n\n4. Tested the configuration by starting the complete docker-compose setup and verified that:\n   - Frontend requests are correctly routed to the frontend service\n   - API requests are properly forwarded to the backend service\n   - The services can communicate with each other through the Nginx proxy\n\nThe basic reverse proxy setup is now complete and functioning as expected. This implementation provides a solid foundation that can be extended with additional security features, SSL configuration, and performance optimizations in the future.\n</info added on 2025-05-06T11:47:05.809Z>",

Implement REST API authentication for the C# OpenFeasyo game using the provided C# integration examples. Ensure both clients connect to the same Supabase Auth instance for unified authentication. Configure client initialization with appropriate environment variables and connection settings.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n\nPhase 1: Vue.js Dashboard Integration\n1. Create a Supabase Client Plugin/Service:\n   - File: frontend/src/plugins/supabase.ts (or frontend/src/services/supabaseClient.ts)\n   - Initialize Supabase client (createClient from @supabase/supabase-js) using VITE_SUPABASE_URL and VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY from import.meta.env\n   - Export the initialized supabase client\n   - Ensure frontend/.env.local and frontend/.env.example contain the necessary environment variables:\n     VITE_SUPABASE_URL=http://localhost:8000\n     VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_from_supabase_config_env\n\n2. Create a Pinia Auth Store:\n   - File: frontend/src/stores/authStore.ts\n   - Uses the Supabase client\n   - State: user: User | null, session: Session | null, loading: boolean, error: Error | null\n   - Actions:\n     - initializeAuthListener(): Calls supabase.auth.getSession() and sets up supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange() to update store state\n     - signInWithPassword(email, password): Calls supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()\n     - signUpWithPassword(email, password, options?): Calls supabase.auth.signUp()\n     - signOut(): Calls supabase.auth.signOut()\n     - sendPasswordResetEmail(email): Calls supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail()\n     - updatePassword(newPassword): Calls supabase.auth.updateUser()\n   - Getters: isAuthenticated: boolean\n\n3. Integrate Store in App:\n   - In frontend/src/main.ts or App.vue, call authStore.initializeAuthListener() on app mount\n\nPhase 2: C# OpenFeasyo Game Integration\n1. Create SupabaseAuthService.cs:\n   - Encapsulate REST API calls to Supabase auth endpoints (/auth/v1/...)\n   - Store SUPABASE_URL (\"http://localhost:8000\") and ANON_KEY as constants/config\n   - Methods (Async):\n     - SignInWithPasswordAsync(email, password)\n     - SignUpWithPasswordAsync(email, password, jsonData?)\n     - SignOutAsync(accessToken)\n     - SendPasswordResetEmailAsync(email)\n     - GetUserAsync(accessToken)\n     - RefreshTokenAsync(refreshToken)\n     - UpdateUserAsync(accessToken, jsonData)\n   - Define request/response DTOs (AuthResponse, UserResponse)\n   - Implement JSON serialization/deserialization and error handling\n\n2. Secure Token Management in C#:\n   - Implement secure storage for JWTs (access & refresh tokens) using OS-level APIs (Windows Data Protection, macOS Keychain, Android Keystore, iOS Keychain) or encrypted local files as a fallback\n   - SupabaseAuthService.cs will receive/return tokens, not store them internally\n\nCross-cutting Concerns:\n- Ensure correct access to environment variables (Supabase URL, Anon Key) in both apps\n- Implement user-friendly error display based on Supabase/API responses\n- Refer to docs/environments/supabase_api_security_config.md for endpoint details and C# examples\n- Use Supabase JS client documentation for Vue/Pinia best practices\n</info added on 2025-05-08T09:26:52.891Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-09T10:14:56.220Z>\nThe Nginx proxy configuration has been successfully fixed to properly handle authentication requests between the frontend and Supabase Kong. The solution addressed several key issues:\n\n1. The Nginx configuration for auth endpoints was simplified to ensure proper request routing\n2. Header passthrough was corrected to maintain authentication context when proxying to Supabase Kong\n3. The Host header is now correctly set for Supabase Kong to properly process authentication requests\n4. Environment variables in the frontend were fixed:\n   - VITE_SUPABASE_URL was updated to http://localhost (removed trailing slash)\n   - Removed an erroneous trailing % character from the ANON_KEY value\n\nComprehensive documentation of the fix has been created at `docs/supabase-auth-fix.md` for future reference.\n\nThe next implementation phase will focus on developing the password reset functionality for both the Vue.js dashboard and C# OpenFeasyo applications, building on the now-working authentication foundation.\n\nThis resolves the proxy-related authentication issues that were blocking progress on the authentication implementation. Both clients can now successfully communicate with the Supabase Auth instance.\n</info added on 2025-05-09T10:14:56.220Z>",
