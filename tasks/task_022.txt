# Task ID: 22
# Title: Security Testing and Hardening
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 9, 14, 15
# Priority: high
# Description: Conduct comprehensive security testing and implement security hardening measures to protect sensitive patient data and prevent vulnerabilities, with special focus on the unified authentication system serving both the Ghostly Game and Web Dashboard applications.
# Details:
1. Conduct security audit of the application:
   - Static code analysis
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Manual code review for security issues
   - Specific review of unified authentication components
2. Implement security hardening measures:
   - Secure HTTP headers
   - Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection
   - SQL injection prevention
3. Enhance authentication security:
   - Rate limiting for login attempts
   - Multi-factor authentication option
   - Session management improvements
   - Consistent JWT handling and validation across platforms
   - Platform-specific authentication safeguards
4. Test unified authentication system:
   - Authentication flows from Ghostly Game application
   - Authentication flows from Web Dashboard application
   - Cross-platform authentication vulnerabilities
   - JWT token security and validation across platforms
5. Implement secure deployment practices:
   - Secret management
   - Environment separation
   - Least privilege principle
6. Create security documentation and incident response plan:
   - Document unified authentication architecture
   - Detail security considerations for both client environments
   - Specify cross-platform security protocols
7. Conduct penetration testing:
   - Target authentication endpoints used by both applications
   - Test for authentication bypass vulnerabilities
   - Attempt session hijacking across platforms
8. Implement security monitoring and alerting:
   - Audit authentication logs from both applications
   - Set up alerts for suspicious authentication patterns
   - Monitor cross-platform authentication attempts

# Test Strategy:
- Automated security scanning with tools like OWASP ZAP
- Penetration testing by security experts with focus on unified authentication endpoints
- Test authentication security measures across both Ghostly Game and Web Dashboard
- Test authentication flows in both directions to ensure consistent security
- Verify secure headers and CSP
- Test for common vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10)
- Validate encryption implementation
- Review security logs and monitoring with special attention to cross-platform authentication
- Verify proper JWT handling, validation, and expiration across platforms
- Test for vulnerabilities specific to cross-platform authentication systems
- Audit authentication logs to confirm proper tracking of logins from both applications
