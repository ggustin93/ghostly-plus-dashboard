# Task ID: 5
# Title: C3D File Parser Development
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a Python module to parse, validate, and extract relevant data from C3D files generated by the OpenFeasyo game and EMG sensors.
# Details:
1. Research and select appropriate C3D parsing library for Python (e.g., ezc3d, c3d, or pyCGM2)
2. Create a C3DParser class with methods to:
   - Load and validate C3D files
   - Extract EMG signal data
   - Extract metadata (recording date, duration, etc.)
   - Extract game metrics if included in the C3D file
3. Implement data transformation functions:
   - Convert raw EMG data to appropriate formats for analysis
   - Normalize signals if needed
   - Extract key metrics (e.g., muscle activation patterns)
4. Add error handling for corrupted or invalid C3D files
5. Optimize for performance with large files (>100MB)
6. Create utility functions for common operations on extracted data
7. Document the parser API and usage examples

# Test Strategy:
- Test with sample C3D files from the OpenFeasyo game
- Validate extracted data against known values
- Benchmark performance with large files
- Test error handling with corrupted files
- Verify all required metrics can be extracted
- Unit test individual parser components
